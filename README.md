## Beware of duplicates & ripoffs
I've learned that there are people who perfere to copy the plugin under thier name
instead of using the original one.
beware of those duplications as they may contain malicous code,
also, you won't get updates and bugfixes as frequantly.
personally, i think those kind of people are harming opensource community.

Known Duplications:
 - Cypher's
