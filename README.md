## Beware of duplicates & ripoffs
I've learned that there are people who prefer to copy the plugin under their name
instead of using the original one.
beware of those duplications as they may contain malicious code,
also, you won't get updates and bugfixes as frequently.
personally,I think those kind of people are harming opensource community.

Known Duplications:
 - Cypher's
